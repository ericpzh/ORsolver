How to use it:

1) Download the zip and a python3 IDE (pycharm etc.)

2) Download the libaraies in each file that you need (numpy etc.)

3) Make sure the file structure is correct (for pycharm create your own project and copy all files you need into the project folder (leaving the original folder alone and only copy the files))

4) Change the numbers in the input matrices (within the code) and hit run!

5) Read the comments and find out what each function offers

6) Check back repo for latest update
